This is an app to checkout and follow step by step instructions for building stuff with your hands.

There are countless fantastic instructional videos on YouTube on how to make virtually anything but you have to pause them to write down materials and tools you need. Then you have to go to the hardware store and try to figure out what you wrote down, then try to find the spot in the video where they list the materials, and thats if you have service on your phone in the store.

With my app, following a model similar to recipe apps, you can view projects and see all the necessary materials and tools you need. You can then follow step by step instructions to create your own amazing stuff - from bird feeders to furniture.
